# AMS315-Data-Analysis-Project1
This repository contains work for AMS 315 Data Analysis Project 1. The project consists two parts, though the goal for both parts is to obtain a linear regression model, they use different methods to achieve the objective. 
For the first part, IV and DV are separated into two files and they both contains some NA values for IV, DV or both. We need to: merge the files, impute the missing values, and get a linear regression model. 
For the second part, while IV and DV are in the same file and the data set does not have any missing values, an approximate LOF test should be applied. We need to: find the repeated values and bin near repeated value into one group, and perform a LOF test.
